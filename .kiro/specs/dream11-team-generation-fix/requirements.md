# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the team generation issues in the Dream11 application where teams are not being generated properly due to sampling errors and captain/vice-captain selection problems. The system needs to reliably generate valid 11-player teams with designated captain and vice-captain positions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Dream11 user, I want the system to generate valid teams without crashing, so that I can participate in fantasy cricket leagues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the team generation process is triggered THEN the system SHALL handle insufficient player categories gracefully without throwing ValueError exceptions
2. WHEN player categories have fewer players than required THEN the system SHALL use all available players from that category and fill remaining slots from other available players
3. WHEN the team generation completes THEN the system SHALL return teams with exactly 11 players each

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Dream11 user, I want each generated team to have a designated captain and vice-captain, so that I can maximize my fantasy points according to Dream11 rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a team is generated THEN the system SHALL designate one player as captain (position 11)
2. WHEN a team is generated THEN the system SHALL designate one player as vice-captain (position 12) 
3. WHEN selecting captain and vice-captain THEN the system SHALL ensure they are different players from the same 11-player team
4. WHEN captain and vice-captain are selected THEN the system SHALL store them as additional metadata without changing the core 11-player team structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Dream11 user, I want the team generation to be robust and handle edge cases, so that I always get valid teams regardless of player availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are insufficient total players (less than 11) THEN the system SHALL return an empty result with appropriate messaging
2. WHEN specific player categories are empty THEN the system SHALL continue team generation using available players from other categories
3. WHEN duplicate players are selected THEN the system SHALL remove duplicates and maintain exactly 11 unique players per team
4. WHEN teams are generated THEN the system SHALL calculate total percentage scores correctly for all team sizes
